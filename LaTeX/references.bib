    abstract = "The debate around climate change (CC){---}its extent, its causes, and the necessary responses{---}is intense and of global importance. Yet, in the natural language processing (NLP) community, this domain has so far received little attention. In contrast, it is of enormous prominence in various social science disciplines, and some of that work follows the {''}text-as-data{''} paradigm, seeking to employ quantitative methods for analyzing large amounts of CC-related text. Other research is qualitative in nature and studies details, nuances, actors, and motivations within CC discourses. Coming from both NLP and Political Science, and reviewing key works in both disciplines, we discuss how social science approaches to CC debates can inform advances in text-mining/NLP, and how, in return, NLP can support policy-makers and activists in making sense of large-scale and complex CC discourses across multiple genres, channels, topics, and communities. This is paramount for their ability to make rapid and meaningful impact on the discourse, and for shaping the necessary policy change.",

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of oil price shocks in the last 30years on the Brazilian and American inflation rate and rhythm of economic activity. The Brazilian and the United States economies are interesting polar cases, since they had a completely different path on the oil import dependence rate. While the oil import dependence rate has increase sharply in the United States (US), it has decreased substantially in Brazil. We found that output growth volatility in the United States has been decreasing over time as well as the contribution of oil price shocks to such volatility, despite the increase in oil import dependence. Inflation volatility has also been decreasing but oil price shocks are accounting for a larger fraction of this volatility in the US. In Brazil, such shocks do not seem to have a clear impact on output growth and they account for a very small fraction of the Brazilian inflation and output growth rate volatility. We finally run some counterfactual experiments to analyze how real output growth in the United States would had been if net oil import share in the United States behaved similarly to what was observed in Brazil. We conclude that output level would be roughly the same, however, it would be about 10% less volatile if the US had the actual Brazilian oil import share.}

This paper suggests a new innovative conceptual framework (the Resilient City Planning Framework or RCPF) that addresses the critical question of what cities and their urban communities should do in order to move towards a more resilient state in the future. Accordingly, the RCPF takes complexity and uncertainty into account. It is affected by a multiplicity of economic, social, spatial, and physical factors and its planning involves a wide range of stakeholders. RCPF is a network of four interlinked concepts that together, provide a comprehensive understanding of City Resilience.}

Measures adopted include providing financial support to extremist groups, conducting cyberattacks, hacking information on political parties and government agencies, and promoting a socially conservative ideology critiquing Western liberal values. This strategy resembles Soviet-era disinformation campaigns, though social media and the Internet have magnified the impact of contemporary information warfare. The article examines specific measures Russia has implemented to put liberal democracy on the defensive, and assesses how these actions impact domestic political processes in the USA, by using a conceptual framework of democratic erosion and democratic breakdown. The article evaluates motivations behind Russian interference in America's 2016 elections, and the extent to which these efforts weaken liberal democracy and advance Russian national interests.},

After a review of the main support policies for PV systems in Europe, the specific situations of five representative countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the U.K.) are examined, with the purpose of describing the main differences in their implementation of support policies adopted for PV systems. In particular, comparisons based on economic indexes such as the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) are carried out for different sized PV systems, showing that in some situations support policies can be inconvenient for the PV system owner. The paper also shows that the best profitability for a PV system owner is obtained in those countries in which there is an active electricity compensation scheme. The comparative analysis carried out in this work could help: –to assess the impact of PV energy policies in European member states;–to predict how the PV market could evolve in the selected EU member states;–to gain an insight into the future of possible energy policies.}

Toward that end, we employed a similar methodology based on review and analysis of recent cost studies for the major CCS options identified in the SRCCS, namely, post-combustion CO2 capture at supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants, plus pre-combustion capture at coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. We also report current costs for SCPC plants employing oxy-combustion for CO2 capture—an option that was still in the early stages of development at the time of the SRCCS. To compare current CCS cost estimates to those in the SRCCS, we adjust all costs to constant 2013 US dollars using cost indices for power plant capital costs, fuel costs and other O&M costs. On this basis, we report changes in capital cost, levelized cost of electricity, and mitigation costs for each power plant system with and without CCS. We also discuss the outlook for future CCS costs.}

    abstract = {Promoting individual lifestyle changes towards pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) has been one of the key strategies for tackling the climate crisis adopted by governments. Messaging to promote PEBs has been used in different contexts – most notably home and workplace settings; however, the message phrasing, opportunities, and motivations for adopting these behaviours can differ between locations. In this study, from a sample of working people, we investigate the sources and themes of PEB messages they remember. We then classify these based on their underlying motivations (egoistic, altruistic or biospheric). We compare these messaging prompts to those PEBs actually tried by participants and the factors leading to their successful or failed adoptions related to institutional or societal norms. Finally we explore what motivates and supports the transfer of adopted contextual PEBs between home and work. Our results highlight that messaging triggering a diversity of motivations may lead to the greatest adoption rates. For transfer of actions to be successful between contexts, both infrastructure and behavioural norms need to receive support for PEB changes to become habitual and ubiquitous.}

The Semantic Orientation CALculator (SO-CAL) uses dictionaries of words annotated with their semantic orientation (polarity and strength), and incorporates intensification and negation. SO-CAL is applied to the polarity classification task, the process of assigning a positive or negative label to a text that captures the text's opinion towards its main subject matter. We show that SO-CAL's performance is consistent across domains and in completely unseen data. Additionally, we describe the process of dictionary creation, and our use of Mechanical Turk to check dictionaries for consistency and reliability.}",

  abstract = {A huge number of videos are posted every day on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This makes the Internet an unlimited source of information. In the coming decades, coping with such information and mining useful knowledge from it will be an increasingly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in harvesting sentiments from Web videos by demonstrating a model that uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. We used both feature- and decision-level fusion methods to merge affective information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing works in this area is carried out throughout the paper, which demonstrates the novelty of our approach. Preliminary comparative experiments with the YouTube dataset show that the proposed multimodal system achieves an accuracy of nearly 80%, outperforming all state-of-the-art systems by more than 20%.}

    abstract = {With regard to ecological sustainability, an aspect of corporate social responsibility (CSR), a shift in business practices towards a stakeholder orientation was observed. However, little research was done on the activities carried out with regard to these stakeholders and the drivers of these activities. Drawing from a resource-based view and stakeholder theory, the current research thus aimed to uncover activities undertaken by companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and examine the ways they communicate these activities to stakeholders in an effort to establish relations with them. By means of 16 semi-structured interviews in 14 companies and using a flexible pattern-matching approach, the results identified contextual, conditional, and intervening conditions that define the basis for a carbon footprint and its quantification, and at the same time influence the actions taken by companies. The findings offer a contribution to ecological sustainability literature and practice by identifying five areas of carbon footprint actions including heating, building, travel, transportation, and green services and products; and by showing that companies direct different actions in these areas towards different stakeholders to build relations with them.}

        abstract = { With high growth rates during the past two decades and the largest trade surplus with the United States, China is the primary target of the U.S. trade war efforts. Tariffs are the first shot in bilateral tensions that are multilateralizing and injuring global economic integration, coupled with ever more intense technology competition. The evolving global scenarios of U.S.-China trade and technology conflicts are the outcome of an ever more anxious America forsaking its multilateral cooperative stances for primacy doctrines. In the worst case, these conflicts may escalate into a “decoupling” of both economies and cause lasting global recession and new geopolitical confrontation. This gloomy scenario has become viable with the exceptional use of executive power by the post-9/11 U.S. administrations. The Trump administration, in particular, is predicated on “imperial presidency” that relies on an emergency status quo, new campaign finance, and “big money,” which poses significant risks not only to U.S.-China relations, but also to American democracy and existing international order. }
